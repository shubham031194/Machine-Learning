# **Introduction to Ridge and Lasso Regression**

Ridge and Lasso are popular machine learning algorithms, specifically used for regression tasks. These methods are crucial in preventing overfitting, which occurs when a model becomes too accurate on the training data, resulting in poor generalization to new, unseen data.
When a machine learning model is overfitted, it captures the noise of the training data rather than the underlying pattern. This leads to poor performance on new data. Regularization techniques like Ridge and Lasso help combat overfitting by adding a penalty to the cost function.

## **Ridge Regression**
In Ridge Regression, we add a penalty (also known as **L2 regularization**) that is proportional to the sum of the squared values of the coefficients. This helps in reducing overfitting by shrinking the coefficient values.

**Key feature:** Ridge regression tends to spread out the error term across multiple features.

**Mathematical Impact:** Helps in reducing the model complexity but does not lead to sparse models (i.e., all coefficients are retained).

## **Lasso Regression**
In Lasso Regression (short for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) introduces L1 regularization, which adds a penalty proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients.

**Key feature:** Lasso encourages some of the coefficients to become exactly zero, thus performing feature selection.

**Mathematical Impact:** Leads to sparse models by eliminating the least important features.

**Notes:**
Ridge and Lasso Regression are powerful tools in machine learning that can help prevent overfitting through regularization. While Ridge reduces model complexity, Lasso performs both regularization and feature selection, making it highly useful in sparse data scenarios.
